# Recession_analysis_using_ML

In the given code, we performed several analyses and created various visualizations using GDP growth and recession data.

1. Correlation Chart:
   - We calculated the correlation matrix of the GDP growth data.
   - The correlation matrix shows the pairwise correlations between different variables in the data.
   - We used the seaborn library to create a heatmap visualization of the correlation matrix.
   - The heatmap uses color gradients to represent the strength and direction of the correlations.
   - This chart helps us understand the relationships between different time periods and their GDP growth rates.

2. Comparison of GDP Growth Rate:
   - We selected specific time periods for comparison (e.g., quarters of different years).
   - The selected GDP growth rates for those time periods were plotted as a bar chart.
   - Each bar represents the GDP growth rate for a particular time period.
   - This chart allows us to compare the GDP growth rates between different time periods visually.
   - It helps us identify trends, patterns, and differences in the economic performance across those periods.

3. GDP Growth and Recession Data:
   - We plotted the GDP growth data over time.
   - The line plot shows the GDP growth rate for each time period.
   - Additionally, we shaded the areas where the economy was in a recession (negative GDP growth rate).
   - The shaded areas help us visualize the recession periods and their impact on the GDP growth.
   - This chart enables us to analyze the relationship between GDP growth and recession occurrences.

4. Recession Severity:
   - We calculated the duration and magnitude of each recession period.
   - The duration represents the number of days the recession lasted.
   - The magnitude indicates the cumulative GDP growth rate during the recession.
   - We plotted a bar chart to visualize the severity of each recession period.
   - Each bar represents the duration of a recession, with the x-axis indicating the start date.
   - This chart provides an overview of the severity and duration of different recession periods.

Overall, these visualizations help us analyze and understand the performance of the economy, the occurrence of recessions, and the severity of the recessions over the given time period. They provide valuable insights into the relationship between GDP growth and economic downturns.
